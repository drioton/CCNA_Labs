# CCNA Labs

This folder contains hands-on labs and practical exercises that I have created for studying and practicing various **CCNA 200-301** topics. These labs are designed to provide real-world scenarios and configurations to help reinforce the theoretical knowledge from my study notes.

### Whatâ€™s Included:
- **Router and Switch Configurations**: Step-by-step labs on setting up routers and switches, configuring VLANs, routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP), and more.
- **Network Design and Troubleshooting**: Exercises on designing network topologies, solving issues with routing, switching, and network connectivity.
- **Advanced Features**: Labs focusing on advanced topics such as Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Access Control Lists (ACLs), and NAT.

These labs are organized to mirror the topics in the CCNA exam and offer a hands-on approach to networking, giving you the experience needed to configure and troubleshoot real-world network environments.

Feel free to clone, fork, or contribute to this repository to share your own labs or improvements!
